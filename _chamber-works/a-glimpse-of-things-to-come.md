For Brass Quintet.

A Glimpse of Things to Come is a piece written for brass quintet in the fall of 2014. The beginning is a slow and optimistic sounding overture with tones of uncertainty showing that things may not be as they seem. With two deep breaths we plunge into the confusing and complex body of the piece. As it draws to an end the sounds fade out until once again we find tones of optimism with underlying tones of uncertainty.

This piece received itâ€™s premiere in December of 2014 in Florence, Alabama.

Instrumentation: 2 trumpets, french horn, trombone, tuba.

Approximate Duration: 5 minutes
