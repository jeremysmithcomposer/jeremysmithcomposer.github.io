The Desert Owns The Compromise is a concept piece written in 2015 for computer, computer keyboard, and projector. This piece uses algorithmically derived text as the foundation for the performer to slowly type out a computer generated poem. Each line is typed in a cycle of itâ€™s unique implied meter and the clicks are met with a visual representation on the projector screen.
