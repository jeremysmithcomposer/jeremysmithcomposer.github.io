The Fourth Wall is a piece for Symphonic Winds and Percussion written

The Fourth Wall is a term used i​n​ theatre which describes an imaginary barrier that keeps performers from recognizing or directly addressing their audience. When a character is said to “Break the Fourth Wall’’ it is usually to explain intents, motives, or events, but when the wall is left intact it is left to the audience to interpret the events in whatever way they find appropriate. This piece is a statement about how that principle can be applied to music as well as to our lives and interactions with those around us.
