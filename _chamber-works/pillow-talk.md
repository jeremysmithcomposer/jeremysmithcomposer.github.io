Pillow Talk is a multi-percussion solo commissioned by Zack O'Bryant in the spring of 2016. This piece uses an audio track to establish a dialogue with the performer. The track is a point of reference while the live counterpoint obscures the pulse and shifts metric orientation.

Instrumentation: Multi-Percussion and Electronic Playback

Approximate Duration: 3 and half minutes
