Today was a good day. I finished Act Three. I now have a first draft of the entire production. Currently it sits at around 21 minutes. Tomorrow I will begin the revision process on Act One. I hope that after a few weeks away from the first act I can expand a little more on the ideas which I thought were lacking. The goal was to leave with close to 30 minutes of music. I feel very confident that this goal will be met.

After I finished working for the day I started on my work trade. I have to finish 5 and a half hours of work around and for the house over the next 3 days. I have always said that one of my biggest strengths is being able to put things off until the very last second. Maybe one day I will try to get better about that.

3 days left
