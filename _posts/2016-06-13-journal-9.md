I got a little bit of work done early this morning. Around 1 o'clock we went out hiking. Some of the views out here are incredible. The mountains seem to go on forever. I have really never seen anything like it. 

By the time we got back another resident had arrived. A writer in his very late 20's. He is working on his second novel while he is here. He gave me a copy of his first novel which I have read a little bit of. It is a very interesting idea. 

Tomorrow I will sojourn on into Act Two.
