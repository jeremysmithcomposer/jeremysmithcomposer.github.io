Not much to write about today. After staying up until around 3:30 this morning I was up by 9:30 and at it again. I worked for 13 hours today only taking the occasional short break and eating meals while working. I spent most of the day locked away in my room. I am feeling very determined and very tired. 

Tomorrow a new person is supposed to arrive. Apparently a sculptor. Should be interested to see this person work. I hope this next person is a little more fun than the last. 

Tomorrow I will finish Act one.
