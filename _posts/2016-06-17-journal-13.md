134 years ago today a man was born who would forever change the history of Western music. This man would go on to pioneer 3 distinct movements and become one of the most influential figures of 20th century music. His name was Igor Stravinsky. Today at Azule I took a day off of composing and we all took the day to celebrate Stravinsky's birthday... and Betsey's last day at the residency (Honestly I was the only one celebrating Stravinsky's birthday). It was a very fun and relaxing day. A lot of sitting around outside, talking, enjoying one another's company, food, and la vie boheme-ing. 

Tomorrow I will jump into Act III.
