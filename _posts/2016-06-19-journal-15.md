I worked for about 6 hours today, and finished 3 minutes of music. I am at the halfway point for the final act. I hope I can finish in the next few days.

After finishing work Shane and I went down into town for some nachos we have been eyeing for the past week or so. It his last night at Azule. He will leave tomorrow. After that it will be back down to Camille and I for just a few days.
