Today's journal comes a little early. I wrote the story about Camille. I gave her the piece that I wrote for her. I took pictures. Swept, mopped, and dusted. I finished my work trade. I packed. I took a deep breath and I looked around. My last day in this house. It has been an incredible experience. I have accomplished everything I set out to and more. A few weeks ago I entered this house a little nervous. Tomorrow, I will leave. It has become a home. I have made friends, had conversations, hiked, swam, thought... oh yea... and wrote a 25 minute ballet.

Tonight I will get to bed early. Tomorrow I will pack the car and leave to meet my friends at Music City Drum Corps in Nashville. This will start the second leg of my summer. I will be in Nashville for about 4 days before we embark on tour. On July 9th I will take a bus back from Madison, Wisconsin to Chicago. Then Chicago to Nashville. I will do 3 weeks of teaching (and 4 days back in Florence) before heading back for the last bit of tour. 

All things must come to an end, and this residency is no different. It has been a trip.
