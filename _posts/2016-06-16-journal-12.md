Act Two is complete. I am super happy with it. It lasts a little over 6 minutes. That gives me 8 more days to finish the third act and to revise the entire production. 

We ended up getting a definitive answer to the abandoned house. Apparently it isn’t abandoned, and some wise mountain guru lives there and provides council over bonfires to the youth of the town. Strange. At least we know that it was our overactive imaginations and that we aren’t surrounded by cult members or something.

The two other residents and I have really hit it off. It is exactly what I had hoped for. We share meals, inspirations, and discuss our creation process. I feel like I have learned a lot just being around them. This second week has been a lot of fun.
