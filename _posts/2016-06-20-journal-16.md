Shane left around 9:30 this morning. Camille left for Asheville around 10:30 so I had the entire house to myself today. I got a little bit of work done, and finished some more of my work trade. One of the responsibilities I have been given for the work trade is fixing a guitar. I thought I had entered this program just a tad over my head by trying to write the music for a ballet. Then I started trying to fix a guitar. I think I can do it, but I cannot promise that there won't be wood glue all over it. 

4 days and 5 nights left.
