Today has been a pretty slow day. I got around a minute and a half of music done. I took a few naps and kind of lounged around for most of the day.

The three of us all sat up talking last night until very late. It is nice to have some more people here after having been alone for a week. It has changed the dynamic in the house. Everyone stays very quiet and works all day on their respective projects.

It has been super hot in the house today. I think that it ended up getting close to 95 degrees outside, and probably at least 85 in the house. I can hear thunder rolling in the distance. I hope that it rains like crazy.
