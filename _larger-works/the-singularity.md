 “The Singularity” is a ballet about artificial intelligence, but more than that it is a coming of age story. The story progresses as we witness a computer self-actualizing. We see the computer struggling with the idea of life itself, existential questions, and ultimately coming to grips with the reality of itself a cognizant being. This mirrors the stages that we all go through as we struggle to understand, define, and decide what life is really about. So while it is about a computer we are able to see ourselves and the processes we go through recognizing our own power and responsibility. The story is loosely based off of Rene Descartes work “Meditations” and the now famous realization “cogito ergo sum” (in english “I think, therefore I am”).

It was written during the summer of 2016 at Azule Artist Residency in Hot Springs, North Carolina. It received it’s premiere on April 21st, 2017.
