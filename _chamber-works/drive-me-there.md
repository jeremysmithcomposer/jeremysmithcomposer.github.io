Drive Me There was written in the Summer of 2016 during a stay at The Azule House in Hot Springs, North Carolina, in appreciation of Camille Shaffer’s hospitality, inspiration, and genuineness.

“There are all sorts of strange little features in this house that really make no sense. Doors in strange places and windows in the ceiling. The kind of things you look at and say "Why did she do that?". Her and her husband were married on an airplane 2,000 feet in the sky. They drove around the country in a van for almost a year looking for a place to settle down. When they arrived here they turned the van off. They lived here for 44 years. He died in this house around a decade ago after a long battle with muscular sclerosis. Suddenly everything made sense. The strange doors were for his wheelchair. The odd windows were so he could look up and see the stars from his bed. On his last night she said he kept saying "Drive me there. Drive me there". She said she has no idea what he meant. She kind of laughed and shrugged while saying "I drove him crazy his whole life. Maybe this is what he meant." He is buried just a little ways from this house under a stone that is inscribed with the phrase "Drive me there". She must have really loved him.”
